Problem #3
    The fibbonacci sequence goes as follows: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 etc
    Write a class fibbonacci that contains a function to calculate the nth fibbonacci number. The constructor will take in a shift, so if the shift is 5, then the fibbonacci goes as follows: 5,5,10,15,25 etc...
    The catch? You may not use any iteration in the entire program nor may you call on any frameworks within python that use iteration. This must be solved using recurson.

    Extra points if the recursive function only takes in one parameter.
