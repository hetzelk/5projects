Heres your homework for the day so you can get started. Let me know if you have any questions.

Iteration - for, while, foreach 
Recursion
Function Overloading and Defaulting Parameters/ Constructors and Destructors


Problem #1
    Users are the worst- they are always forgetting how to use the software properly. Write a program that barks at the user every time they enter in the same input twice. You must use a while loop to continually ask the user for input, and you must use a for loop to iterate through the list of user inputs

Problem #2
    In this problem, you MUST use a 2 dimensional list, and you MUST use nested loops
    Write a class has a constructor which takes in a number and creates a 2 dimensional list with length and height matching that number.

    Write three functions, Triangle, BackwardsTriangle, and UpsideDown Triangle
    given the number 4, Triangle will output
    .
    ..
    ...
    ....

    BackwardsTriange will output
      .
     ..
    ...
    ....

    UpsideDownTriangle will output
    ....
    ...
    ..
    .



Problem #3
    The fibbonacci sequence goes as follows: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 etc
    Write a class fibbonacci that contains a function to calculate the nth fibbonacci number. The constructor will take in a shift, so if the shift is 5, then the fibbonacci goes as follows: 5,5,10,15,25 etc...
    The catch? You may not use any iteration in the entire program nor may you call on any frameworks within python that use iteration. This must be solved using recurson.

    Extra points if the recursive function only takes in one parameter.


Problem #4
    Create a class called construction.  Launch a new process of chrome.exe that will automatically open this youtube video when the constructor is called-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_9_q_uLF8
    open this youtube video when the destructor is called ->

Problem #5
    Now that you have more tools in your toolbelt, implement your classes from week 1. You may decide how to implement each function, but you must use at least 2 while loops, 2 for loops, you must override atleast 1 function in both super classes.
